# Roblox-Key-System
based on .php file ( no database needed ) also this is only 1-time key system, if the key is used, it wouldn't longer valid until you get new key


For C#
```
                string key = InputBox.Text; 
                ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue = true;
                ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = (SecurityProtocolType.Ssl3 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls | SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12);
                if (new WebClient().DownloadString("https://yourshitwebsite.xyz/check.php?key=" + key) != "Whitelisted") //change the site with your own site lmfao
                {
                    System.Windows.MessageBox.Show("Invalid Key or Already Used Key");
                    return;
                }
```

What you need:

1.] Your Braincells ( need it badly )

2.] A Custom Domain ofc so google recaptcha will work

3.] Google Recaptcha ( v2 )


Edit the index.php then replace the site key & secret key with yours
